# Superheroe Database
### Group Project
## Purpose
We wanted to create a website were people could easily look up a superheroes, get up to date with the character and also buy items related to the character. Our main target audience are those who do not know much about heroes but still know what is going on.

## Solution
We used "comicvine" as our main api to get information of superheroes. We also used superheroes api to get stats information for the heroes. To create the chart with the stats, we used charts js library. As for the shopping list, we used ebay finding and shopping api.
